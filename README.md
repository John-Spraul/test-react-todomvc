# Todo React App

## Functionality

### No todos

When there are no todos, the todos list section will be hidden.

### New todo

New todos are entered in the input at the top of the app. The input checks that it's not empty before creating a new todo.

### Item

A todo item has these possible interactions:

* Clicking the checkbox marks the todo as complete

* Hovering over the todo shows the remove button

### Counter

Displays the number of active todos in a pluralized form.

## Implementation

This To-Do App was initialized using create-react-app. All DOM manipulation is handled with REACT or CSS.

To run this app, navigate into the directory and run `npm i` in terminal. Once that is done, run `npm start`.
